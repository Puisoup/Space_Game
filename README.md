This is a simple Space Shooter game developed in Unity using C#. The project includes basic game mechanics such as player movement, shooting, enemy ai, health & wave system and much more. It features basic graphics and sound effects to bring the space battle to life.

The source code and resources for the game are fully available in this repository, allowing you to build and play the game yourself. It's a great project for beginners in game development and I learned a lot about Unity and programming with C#.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, feel free to share them!
